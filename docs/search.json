    "text": "As scientists we make A LOT of tables, be it of summary statistics, model parameter values, contrast tables, or anything else. It used to be common practice to copy these individually into Excel or Word and then create a table to insert into your work, but this is prone to errors. No one is perfect after all.\nThis problem has now been solved by a bunch of different packages that allow for tables to be created in R and exported to a variety of formats. This means that fewer mistakes are made, that tables can easily be remade if the data or stats change, and that the process of making your tables is completely reproducible. The R package we will introduce to do this today is flextable, but there are other options available we won’t cover here such as gt.\nflextable provides an easy and flexible way to create tables for reporting and presentations. It allows for customization of the table appearance, including cell borders, font styles, background color, and more. The package also supports different formats such as HTML, Microsoft Word, and PowerPoint. It is well suited for creating reports and presentations with a high level of formatting, while still being simple and straightforward to use. Additionally, flextable has a number of features that make it particularly useful for data visualisation, including the ability to merge cells, add custom functions for data formatting, and control the appearance of the table based on data values (i.e. making p values that are <0.05 bold)."

For example, using ggplot2 and making publication-ready plots. Or making reproducible tables in R using flextable. These intRos are aimed to be brief and designed to get you started using these tools. Throughout we highlight where we find information and our favourite resources for when we get stuck!\nWe hope that this series will be added to through time by other members of the University."
