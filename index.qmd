Welcome to the Exeter Data Analytics Hub intRos series.

## What is the Exeter Data Analytics Hub?

We are an inter-college team of volunteers at the University of Exeter aiming to enhance ECR training in open and reproducible science.

## What is the intRos series?

The intRos series is designed to be a place to provide brief introductions and walkthroughs for activities that are common when programming for research purposes. For example, using **ggplot2** and making publication-ready plots. Or making reproducible tables in R using **flextable**. These intRos are aimed to be brief and designed to get you started using these tools. Throughout we highlight where we find information and our favourite resources for when we get stuck!

We hope that this series will be added to through time by other members of the University.

## Get started

All of the available intRos can be found in the **walkthroughs** tab. All of the reproducible quarto (.qmd) files can be found at the source [GitHub](https://github.com/exeter-data-analytics/intRos) repository for this website. You can navigate to each of the directories individually in the `posts/` folder, or better still clone the repo using `git clone` and open the project in RStudio. 

A summary of available walkthroughs is below:

- Reproducible tables with **flextable**
- Making publication-ready plots with **ggplot2**
- Managing research projects with **RStudio**
