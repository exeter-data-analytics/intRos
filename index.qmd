Welcome to the Exeter Data Analytics Hub intRos series.

## What is the Exeter Data Analytics Hub?

We are an inter-college team of volunteers at the University of Exeter aiming to enhance ECR training in open and reproducible science.

## What is the intRos series?

The intRos series is designed to be a place to provide brief introductions and walkthroughs for activities that are common when programming for research purposes. For example, using **ggplot2** and making publication-ready plots. Or making reproducible tables in R using **flextable**. These intRos are aimed to be brief and designed to get you started using these tools. Throughout we highlight where we find information and our favourite resources for when we get stuck!

We hope that this series will be added to through time by other members of the University.

## Get started

All of the available intRos can be found in the **walkthroughs** tab. A summary of available walkthroughs is below:
